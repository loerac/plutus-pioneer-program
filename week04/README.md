### Monad
Start off with learning [monads](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads) (a beefed up applicative functors).
To get a better understanding with monads, we'll work on some examples that use monads
* [Maybe](http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads#getting-our-feet-wet-with-maybe)
* [Either](http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more#error)

Monads are used in the wallets and off-chain code, these are called Contract Monad
